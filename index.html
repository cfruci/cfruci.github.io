						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>
							I live in Denver with my beautiful wife and sons. We spend a lot of time outside in the backyard and on
							walks around our neighborhood. We laugh a lot. We're happy and blessed.
						</p>
						<p>
							I've had a winding, yet fulfilling career thus far. After graduating from Vanderbilt in 2013, I moved to
							Colorado with a few of my closest friends. We played progressive rock music together in a band called
							Archive Nights. It was a special time of life.
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								Our Clock Ocean - EP holds a particularly special place in my heart. Check it out
								<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1OQZFaLfgf6OSuP5WBZVIh?si=jx0owyDYTCaH9RvzqbQaAw">here.</a>
								Every once in awhile, I'll listen back to this album and get emotional. Songs like "Why I" and "Clock
								Ocean," especially, feel like they were gifted to us.
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							Around the time Archive Nights broke up, I joined the DaVita "Village" in 2015 as a Corporate Strategy
							Analyst. Our team - "The Scouts" - was full of thoughtful, intelligent, and kind people. I grew a lot
							personally and professionally here. And we had a lot of fun.
						</p>
						<p>
							I left DaVita in 2018 to give music another shot. My bandmate Will and I knew we'd regret it if we didn't
							give everything we had to a new and exciting project,<a href="https://www.compassandcavern.com/"
								>Compass + Cavern</a
							>. Over the next 7 years, we took risks and grew into better performers. We learned how to be business
							owners and turn a creative endeavor into a profitable enterprise. I'm so proud of what we accomplished.
						</p>
						<p>
							We fought hard through COVID, got married to our spouses, and became parents. In 2025, shortly after
							releasing a full-length album, we entered an indefinite hiatus but excited to pursue other projects. We're
							still performing together in a rock Disney cover band called
							<a href="https://themancubs.com/">The Man Cubs</a> with three other close friends. It's a thrill.
						</p>
						<p>
							After leaving DaVita, I started a freelance content writing business to pay the bills. I started off
							making $40/post for articles that would take me 4-5 hours to write. Within two years, I was supporting
							10-12 businesses at a time and providing a much wider range of content and growth marketing services. I
							started studying the art of persuasion and craft of writing much more closely. And under the guidance of
							several key marketers in my life, I've expanded into a marketing generalist.

						<h2>Guidelines</h2>
						<p>
							Contributing a stylesheet to Style Stage means you agree to abide by
							<a href="/guidelines/">our full guidelines</a>.
						</p>
						<h3>TL;DR</h3>
						<p>
							All submissions will be autoprefixed and prepended with the
							<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA license</a> as well as
							attribution using the metadata you provide. You may use any build setup you prefer, but the final
							submission should be the compiled, unminified CSS. You retain the copyright to original graphics and must
							ensure all graphics used are appropriately licensed. All asset links, including fonts, must be absolute to
							external resources. Stylesheets will be saved into the Github repo, and detected changes that violate the
							guidelines are cause for removal.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ensure your design is responsive, and that it passes accessible contrast (we'll be using aXe to verify).
							Animations should be removed via `prefers-reduced-motion`. Cutting-edge techniques should come with a
							fallback if needed to not severely impact the user experience. No content may be permanently hidden, and
							hidden items must come with an accessible viewing technique. Page load time should not exceed 3 seconds.
						</p>
						<p>
							Most importantly - have fun and learn something new! Check out the <a href="/resources/">resources</a> for
							tips and inspiration.
